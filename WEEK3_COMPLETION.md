**Features:**
- Supports both Redis Streams and NATS JetStream
- Multi-tenant isolation via namespacing
- Encryption at rest and in transit (HIPAA compliant)
- Authentication via AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic failover (2+ nodes)
- CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
- Automated backups (7-90 day retention)

**Files Created:**

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Redis as default:** Simpler for small deployments, easier to manage
2. **NATS as option:** Better for advanced messaging patterns, higher throughput
3. **Per-client namespacing:** `tenant:{client_id}:*` pattern for isolation
4. **mTLS enforcement:** All connections encrypted by default
5. **Cost optimization tiers:** t3.micro ($12/mo) → m5.large ($120/mo)

**HIPAA Controls Implemented:**
- §164.312(a)(2)(iv) - Encryption at rest (KMS)
- §164.312(e)(1) - Transmission security (TLS)
- §164.312(b) - Audit controls (CloudWatch logs)

---

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Cloud-init for bootstrap:** Standard, well-tested approach
2. **Nix installation:** Multi-user mode for security
3. **Flake-based deployment:** Reproducible, version-controlled configuration
4. **IAM roles for secrets:** No embedded credentials
5. **Separate log groups:** Per-service log segregation

**Instance Sizing Guide:**
- Small clinic (1-5 providers): t3.micro, $7.50/mo
- Medium clinic (6-15 providers): t3.small, $15/mo
- Large clinic (15+ providers): t3.medium, $30/mo

---

### 3. Network Discovery System (`discovery/`)

**Purpose:** Multi-method device discovery for automated enrollment

**Components:**

#### scanner.py (419 lines)
- **Active scanning:** nmap-based comprehensive discovery
- **Passive monitoring:** ARP traffic analysis
- **SNMP discovery:** Network device enumeration
- **Multi-method orchestration:** Parallel discovery execution
- **Deduplication:** Merge results from multiple sources

**Discovery Methods:**
1. **Active nmap:**
   - Ping sweep for live hosts
   - Service fingerprinting
   - OS detection
   - Version identification

2. **Passive ARP:**
   - Broadcast traffic monitoring
   - Zero-impact discovery
   - Captures intermittent devices

3. **SNMP walk:**
   - Authoritative device data
   - Network infrastructure focus
   - Query sysDescr, sysName, sysLocation

#### classifier.py (571 lines)
- **Device type classification:** 20+ device types
- **Tier assignment:** 3-tier monitoring complexity model
- **Monitoring strategy:** Per-device monitoring approach
- **HIPAA control mapping:** Controls assigned per device type
- **Exclusion rules:** Infra-only scope enforcement

**Device Types Recognized:**
- Linux/Windows/macOS servers
- Network infrastructure (switches, routers)
- Firewalls and VPN gateways
- Database servers
- Web/application servers
- Workstations (excluded by default)
- Printers (excluded by default)
- Medical devices (DICOM, HL7, PACS)

**Tier Definitions:**
- **Tier 1:** Infrastructure (easy) - Linux/Windows servers, network gear
- **Tier 2:** Applications (moderate) - Databases, workstations
- **Tier 3:** Business processes (complex) - Medical devices, EHR

#### enrollment.py (553 lines)
- **Pipeline orchestration:** Discovery → Classification → Enrollment
- **Agent deployment:** SSH-based bootstrap for servers
- **Agentless setup:** SNMP/syslog for network gear
- **Terraform generation:** Auto-generate device configurations
- **MCP registration:** Device registration with central server

**Enrollment Flow:**
1. Discover devices (multi-method)
2. Classify devices (type + tier)
3. Filter for monitoring (should_monitor flag)
4. Queue for enrollment (auto vs manual)
5. Deploy agents (SSH bootstrap)
6. Register with MCP (API call)
7. Generate evidence (audit trail)

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Async-first:** All I/O operations use asyncio
2. **Graceful degradation:** Missing dependencies don't break the system
3. **Metadata-only:** No PHI processed during discovery
4. **Configurable exclusions:** Respect infra-only scope
5. **Evidence trail:** All actions logged and signed

**HIPAA Considerations:**
- No PHI exposure during discovery (system/network layer only)
- Stealth scanning options to avoid DoS
- Audit trail for all discovery actions
- Device classification privacy (no PHI-revealing patterns)
- Least-privilege service accounts
