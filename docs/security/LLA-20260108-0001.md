## Disclaimers Added

### 1. Portal Dashboard Footer (PortalDashboard.tsx)

```
Important: This system monitors configuration states and reports observations.
OsirisCare does not certify HIPAA compliance. Compliance determinations require
qualified assessment by authorized personnel. Contact your compliance officer
for official guidance. All metrics represent point-in-time observations, not
guarantees of security or compliance status.
```

### 2. Portal Login Footer (PortalLogin.tsx)

```
This portal provides monitoring data only. OsirisCare does not certify compliance.
```

### 3. Portal Dashboard Data Notice (existing, preserved)

```
This report contains system metadata only. No Protected Health Information (PHI)
is processed, stored, or transmitted by the monitoring system.
```

## Terminology Glossary

| Prohibited Term | Replacement | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Compliance | Control Coverage | Describes measurement, not certification |
| Compliant | Expected State | Observation, not judgment |
| Protected | Enabled/Configured | Configuration fact, not guarantee |
| Guaranteed | Attempted | Action taken, not outcome promised |
| Passing/Failing | Expected/Drift Detected | Observation of state change |
| Fixed | Remediation Attempted | Action taken, verification separate |
| Secure | Configured | Configuration state, not security guarantee |

## Compliance Impact

### Before Audit

- UI language implied OsirisCare certifies HIPAA compliance
- "Passing/Failing" terminology suggested compliance judgment authority
- No disclaimers limiting liability scope
- Potential regulatory exposure if client relied on dashboard as compliance certification

### After Audit

- All language reflects observation/monitoring role only
- Status indicators describe configuration state, not compliance status
- Clear disclaimers establish monitoring-only scope
- Liability for compliance determination rests with client's compliance officer

---

## Recommended Follow-up

1. **Backend Email Templates** - Review `email_alerts.py` for similar language patterns
2. **Documentation** - Audit `docs/` folder for customer-facing materials
3. **Terms of Service** - Ensure ToS reinforces monitoring-only scope
4. **Sales Materials** - Review any marketing content for compliance claims
